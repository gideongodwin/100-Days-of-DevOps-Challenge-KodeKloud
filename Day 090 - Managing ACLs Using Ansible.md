## Day 90 - Managing ACLs Using Ansible

## Task Details:

There are some files that need to be created on all app servers in Stratos DC. The Nautilus DevOps team want these files to be owned by user `root` only however, they also want that the app specific user to have a set of permissions on these files.

All tasks must be done using Ansible only, so they need to create a playbook. Below you can find more information about the task.

- Create a playbook named `playbook.yml` under `/home/thor/ansible` directory on `jump host`, an `inventory` file is already present under `/home/thor/ansible` directory on `Jump Server` itself.

    - Create an empty file `blog.txt` under `/opt/finance/` directory on app server 1. Set some `acl` properties for this file. Using `acl` provide `read '(r)'` permissions to group `tony` (i.e `entity` is `tony` and `etype` is `group`).
    
    - Create an empty file `story.txt` under `/opt/finance/` directory on app server 2. Set some `acl` properties for this file. Using `acl` provide `read + write '(rw)'` permissions to `user steve` (i.e `entity` is `steve` and `etype` is `user`).
    
    - Create an empty file `media.txt` under `/opt/finance/` on app server 3. Set some `acl` properties for this file. Using `acl` provide `read + write '(rw)'` permissions to group `banner` (i.e `entity` is `banner` and `etype` is `group`).
    
    > Validation will try to run the playbook using command `ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml` so please make sure the playbook works this way, without passing any extra arguments.

## Steps:

1. Go to the Ansible directory
    ```
    cd ansible
    ```

2. Create the Playbook file and add the following configurations
    ```
    vi playbook.yml
    ```
    ```
    - name: Setup file and ACL on App Server 1
      hosts: stapp01
      become: yes
      tasks:
        - name: Create empty file blog.txt owned by root
          file:
            path: /opt/finance/blog.txt
            state: touch
            owner: root
            group: root
    
        - name: Set ACL for group tony with read permission
          acl:
            path: /opt/finance/blog.txt
            entity: tony
            etype: group
            permissions: r
            state: present
    
    - name: Setup file and ACL on App Server 2
      hosts: stapp02
      become: yes
      tasks:
        - name: Create empty file story.txt owned by root
          file:
            path: /opt/finance/story.txt
            state: touch
            owner: root
            group: root
    
        - name: Set ACL for user steve with read and write permission
          acl:
            path: /opt/finance/story.txt
            entity: steve
            etype: user
            permissions: rw
            state: present
    
    - name: Setup file and ACL on App Server 3
      hosts: stapp03
      become: yes
      tasks:
        - name: Create empty file media.txt owned by root
          file:
            path: /opt/finance/media.txt
            state: touch
            owner: root
            group: root
    
        - name: Set ACL for group banner with read and write permission
          acl:
            path: /opt/finance/media.txt
            entity: banner
            etype: group
            permissions: rw
            state: present
    ```

4.Run the playbook
  ```
  ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
  ```
